# DroneScout V6 - Changes and Improvements

## Release Date
October 31, 2025

## Critical Fixes

### 1. **Fixed Map Not Showing (CRITICAL)**
**Problem:** Map wasn't displaying online because Leaflet library only loaded on desktop devices.

**Solution:**
- Removed conditional loading logic that skipped mobile devices
- Changed from `document.write()` to proper `<link>` and `<script>` tags
- Leaflet now loads on ALL devices and deployments

**Code Changes:**
```html
<!-- OLD (V5) -->
<script>
    if (!/iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        document.write('<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css">');
        document.write('<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"><\/script>');
    }
</script>

<!-- NEW (V6) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```

### 2. **Improved Map Popups**
**Enhancement:** Added risk score and label to marker popups

**Before:** `Spot Name | Distance`
**After:** `Spot Name | Risk: 85 (Clear) | Distance`

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
**Improvement:** Changed Leaflet loading errors from warnings to proper errors with actionable messages

**Before:** `console.warn('Leaflet library not loaded, skipping map (mobile device?)')`
**After:** `console.error('❌ Leaflet library failed to load - check network connection')`
